	<h1>Creating Better Futures of Work: Understanding the Relationships Between Work, the Worker, and the Workplace</h1>
	</header>
	<p>What do we seek out of a thing called work? In the world of work, how we view and relate to work is the primary challenge of our times. Our relationship to work mirrors our relationship to how we live and how we conduct our societies and seek out change within them. Work itself cannot exist separately from societal concepts and rather is interrelated to health, community, government, science and research, war, politics, etc. It is through these larger seen and unseen relationships that we enter the present of work but have you wondered what work actually is and what do people mean when they say about the future of work? And what is it about work that isnâ€™t working?</p>
	<p>In this article, we explore the evolutionary dimensions of self in relation to work, including inherited identity, sense-making, self-study and meaning-making, and mastery. We also consider the role of power and privilege in shaping our experiences and opportunities in the world of work, and examine issues such as the gender pay gap, work-life balance, and the impact of the workplace on our well-being. Finally, we look at the role of education and training, and the impact of government policies, in shaping the future of work.</p>
	<h2>Our Work Evolves with Us: Views of Work in the Past</h2>
	<p>Work has evolved over time, and our understanding and relationship with work has also changed. In the past, work was often seen as a magical or spiritual activity, such as in indigenous cultures where work was often intertwined with spiritual rituals and ceremonies. In other cultures, work was seen as a form of study and self-improvement, with apprenticeships and other forms of learning being a key part of the work process.</p>
<p>Today, we see work in a variety of forms, including gig work, traditional employment, and self-employment. Each of these forms of work has its own challenges and opportunities, and it's important to consider how they shape our relationships with work.</p>
<h2>Four Current Forms of a Worker's Identity</h2>
<p>When we think about work and our relationship with it, it's helpful to consider the different dimensions of our identity that are involved. These dimensions can be thought of as the "5WH" of work identity: how, why, what and where, who and when.</p>
<ul>
<li>How: This dimension refers to the meaning and sense-making aspects of work, including how we make sense of our work and its purpose.</li>
<li>Why: This dimension refers to the purpose and motivation behind our work, including our values and goals.</li>
<li>What and where: This dimension refers to our identity as a worker, including our role and the context in which we work.</li>
<li>Who and when: This dimension refers to our sense of belonging and connection to others, including our relationships with coworkers and the broader community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tree Rings of Work Rings</h2>
<p>In addition to these dimensions of work identity, it's also helpful to consider the "tree rings" of our work rings, or the various influences and experiences that shape our relationships with work. These tree rings can include our family, education, culture, and other life experiences, as well as the broader societal and economic forces that shape the world of work.</p>
<h2>What Happens When We Look at the Right Here and Right Now?</h2>
<p>When we focus on the present and ask ourselves questions such as "What gifts can I give?", "What are you practicing in your work?", and "How does your work support society as a whole?", it allows us to consider how we can make work a more transpersonal force for manifestation and change. By reimagining work as a tool of discovery and a means of dismantling oppressive identities, we can create more meaningful and fulfilling work experiences and contribute to positive societal change.</p>
<h2>Challenges of the Future of Work</h2>
<p>As we look to the future of work, there are a number of challenges and opportunities that we need to consider. These include issues such as automation and the potential displacement of workers, the rise of gig work and the gig economy, and the increasing importance of education and training in an increasingly complex and rapidly-changing job market.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, it's important to engage with the issues and stay informed about the latest research and developments. Some organizations that are working on these issues include:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the relationships between work, the worker, and the workplace is crucial for creating better futures of work. By examining our own experiences and identities, and considering the broader societal and economic forces at play, we can work towards creating more meaningful and fulfilling work experiences for ourselves and others. By staying informed and engaged with the latest research and developments, and advocating for more equitable and inclusive workplaces, we can help shape a better future of work for all.</p>
